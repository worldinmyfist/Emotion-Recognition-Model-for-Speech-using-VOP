# Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP
An Emotion Recognition Model for Speech that detects emotions using the features extracted from the speech and the vowel regions of speech.

## Instructions to run the code
### Introduction
The [vop_model](https://github.com/worldinmyfist/Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP/vop_model) folder contains codes that use wav files along with their corresponding vowel regions for training the model. The [non_vop_model](https://github.com/worldinmyfist/Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP/non_vop_model) folder contains code that only uses wav files for training. The [vop_model/emodbdata/wav](https://github.com/worldinmyfist/Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP/vop_model/emodbdata/wav) folder contains the training set and [vop_model/emodbdata_test/wav](https://github.com/worldinmyfist/Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP/vop_model/emodbdata_test/wav) folder contains the testing set. 

### Downloading EmoDB database
* Download the Database from [EmoDB](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UyZSdCm1UWE1tsD8wyVDrQNSL-45DbFg?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwAR0dW933fDCG9SUagiLoHyF2IodESbmyeOUfs476O3ntuD95gWWEZ7ZrsIY).
**NOTE** : I have already downloaded the database and split the files into training and testing sets in the folders [vop_model/emodbdata/wav](https://github.com/worldinmyfist/Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP/vop_model/emodbdata/wav)  and [vop_model/emodbdata_test/wav](https://github.com/worldinmyfist/Emotion-Recognition-Model-for-Speech-using-VOP/vop_model/emodbdata_test/wav).
